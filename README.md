# CPU Dojo

My TDD CPU for a CPU Dojo I'm running at work so we can learn how a CPU works.

## Javascript CPU

All the following assumes you're in the `javascript` folder.

To install you'll need node and grunt-cli installed. Then run

    bower install

## Grunt tasks

To run all of the tests using PhantomJS on the command line
